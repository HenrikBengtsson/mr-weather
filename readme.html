    <h1>Mussel Rock Weather Readme</h1> 
    <p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This website is beta.  It's going to have bugs (all software has bugs) and bad data (stale data, bad sensors, station in rotor, etc.).  Always use your personal judgement before flying.</p>
    <p>I made this website, so I could have a one page dashboard of all the weather monitoring that I check for flying at Mussel Rock.  Having everything in one place allows me to scan through and get a decent idea what is happening out there. 
 Also keep an eye on the Telegram group.  Weather stations are great, but nothing beats pilots on site.<p>
    <br/>
    If you have any feedback, I would be interested in hearing it.  You can email me at RobertMParker [at] gmail.com.  This dashboard is open source, and it's available <a href="https://github.com/RobertMParker/mr-weather"> here on GitHub</a>.  I'll take PRs if you want to change something.
