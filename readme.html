    <h1>Mussel Rock Weather Conditions Readme</h1>
    
    <p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This website is beta.  It is going to have bugs and bad data.  Always use your
      personal judgement before flying.</p>

    <h2>How to use this website</h2>
    <p>This is <b>NOT</b> a site guide to flying at Mussel Rock.  This is just a guide on how to correctly utilize 
      <a href='index.html'>this website.</a>  I made this site for my personal use.  And for the record, I can't claim
      to be an expert on Mussel Rock flying conditions.  I made this website, because I was trying to accumulate enough
      flight hours to complete my P3 rating, and I found the forecasts to generally not be reliable.  And other people
      were flying when conditions on wunderground looked unflyable. I live about 20 minutes away, so if conditions 
      seem good it's easy enough to just hop in the car to check it out.  But it also is a waste of time if conditions 
      are unflyable/unsafe.  I just want to maximize my effort, and I think this website works pretty well as a spot
      check before driving down.
      <br/><br/> 
      So I generally read the whole page top to bottom before deciding to go.  There is data from three wind stations, 
      and individually they each have mediocre data quality.  But if you combine and correlate the data, you can 
      get much more value out of them.  And if you don't look through all the data, you can easily miss the 
      rotor/fog/whitecaps/etc. and then waste a trip out to MR.  I built this website, and even I've wasted a few trips
      due to not looking at all the data.
      <br/><br/> 
      The first station is KCADALYC1, which is hosted at someone's house on Longview drive.  I think that they also
      host the Mussel Rock webcams.  I don't know the person, but I am very grateful for their data.  This station is
      frequently in rotor when the wind has a South component.  The easiest way to confirm that it's in rotor is to 
      compare the wind speed with the station at Coyote.  If Coyote is showing higher winds, then KCADALYC1 is probably
      in rotor.  When it's in rotor, just ignore all the data from this station.
      <br/><br/> 
      The second station is KCADALYC37, which is at the Coyote launch.  If you are standing on launch, and facing 
      the water, it's just on your left.  This station has had some past problems with solar power, and it's battery.
      Those issues seem like they are fixed now.  But it's wind direction sensor is busted.  I took that graph off of
      the website for now, since it's just misleading.  It typically shows data that is S or SSE.  The values
      fluctuate, but they are not accurate.  If it gets fixed, I'll add the graph back.  I like to fly at Coyote, and
      so I end up taking a lot of wind measurements there.  I think this wind meter frequently under-reports data by
      approximately 1-2 mph.
      <br/><br/> 
      The last station is KCASANFR69, which is at Fort Funston.  This station isn't at Mussel Rock, so it can be somewhat
      different.  Most importantly it is higher than the other two stations.  So if there is a wind gradient, it might
      show the wind as higher than the other two meters.  This is important to avoid getting blown over the back.  So 
      if Fort Funston is reporting 20mph, and the others are reporting 12mph, you better be careful.
      <br/><br/> 
      Mussel Rock webcams.  This data might be stale.  I need to figure out how to tell if the image is recent.  But
      check for fog.  It's possible that the fog could be low enough to show up on the webcams, but high enough to
      still be able to do some flying.  It's best to confirm fog levels on the Telegram group.
      <br/><br/> 
      Fort Funston webcams.  These are potentially useful for checking fog height, and a wind sock is in view as well.
      Sometimes you can see hanggliders staging, which can be a good indicator.
      <br/><br/> 
      Pacifica Webcams.  I only show the webcam pointed at the flag, but there are a few webcams at Pacifica.  The ones
      on YouTube are really great video quality.  The flag should act as another data point to confirm wind direction
      and speed.  Remember the flag is around sea level, so it's possible to have light winds there, but stronger
      winds higher.  The pier points directly West, so try to use that to determine the direction of the wind.  This
      webcam can also show whitecaps.  Put it in full screen mode on YouTube to get the best view of potential
      whitecaps.
      <br/><br/> 
      Then there is the tide chart.  The data for the tide chart actually refers to a station at the Golden Gate
      Bridge.  So it's not exactly the same as Mussel Rock.  But you get the big picture of approximately where
      the tide is at, and which way the tide is going to move with time.  And that's what really matters.  Also 
      it's always best to confirm these things visually.
      <br/><br/> 
      And then there is the forecast from Windy.  I don't know how useful that thing is.  But I use it to forecast
      how stable conditions will be.  I don't compare the data from the sensors to Windy.  I check if Windy thinks
      the wind will be consistent or if it thinks that winds will increase/decrease over the next few hours.  In 
      my experience Windy will over report gusts at MR.
      <br/><br/> 
      Also follow the Telegram group for Pacifica.  <b>Nothing</b> beats the knowledge from experienced local pilots
      onsite.
