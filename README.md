Mussel Rock Weather Dashboard

The dashboard website is beta.  It's going to have bugs (all software has bugs) and bad data (stale data, bad sensors, station in rotor, etc.).  Always use your personal judgement before flying.

I made this website, so I could have a one page dashboard of all the weather monitoring that I check for flying at Mussel Rock.  Having everything in one place allows me to scan through and get a decent idea what is happening out there. Also keep an eye on the Telegram group.  Weather stations are great, but nothing beats pilots on site.

If you have any feedback, I would be interested in hearing it.  I created this dashboard for my personal use, but feel free to send me PRs if there is something that you would like to change.

It's a bit janky, since I'm more of a backend software engineer.  But it saves me a lot of time compared to checking the weather dashboards independently.

Safe flights!
